## w3ai Protocol for the AI Economy

- Recursive dual logging of changes in Projects and Tasks/Issues/ToDo lists
- Recursive - to allow dynamic looping/scheduler algo based on customized checks per scheduled activity
- each node server (user) to define his/her interest tags and social network (businesses, employers, colleagues, friends, family, self, etc) 
- each conection in the network to have its own automatically editable list of projects/jobs and services/skills
- first implementation with pytest configured as continuous projects/services checks (same as tests but including i/o exec check queries)
- when checks pass into an executable deal the deal is executed, project updated and service/skill executor check marked to receive payment

# TDD => Social Driven Dev OR Social Driven Innovations

- the TDD should programatically drive Continuous Integration / Cont Deploy 
- and can/should be extended into Social Driven Innovations by to allow early/continuous voting and usage/testing
- an easy way to do it could be with pytest configured to be runned in loops on social nets

## progress protocol / energy coin eÂ¢o

- idea: arrange VS Code files/tabs same as Chrome tabs/files in eco-labs for high speed experiments
- next gen JupiterLabs / Jupiter Project:
